A stochastic process is a collection or ensemble of random variables indexed by a variable, usually representing time. 
Elements of Stochastic Process
Stochastic processes are classified by 
•	State spaces – State space is the range or possible values of all the random variables in a stochastic process 
•	Index / Parameter set – Set of values taken by the index variable 
•	The dependence relations among the random variables

Classification of Stochastic Processes
A Stochastic Process can be classified into four broad categories based on whether the state space and time space are discretized or not.
•	Discrete Space Discrete Time 
•	Discrete Space Continuous Time
•	Continuous Space Discrete Time
•	Continuous Space Continuous Time
