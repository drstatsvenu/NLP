Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) is simply an ANOVA with several dependent variables. That is to say, ANOVA tests for the difference in means between two or more groups, while MANOVA tests for the difference in two or more vectors of means.
MANOVA allows us to test hypotheses regarding the effect of one or more independent variables on two or more dependent variables. A MANOVA analysis generates a p-value that is used to determine whether or not the null hypothesis can be rejected.
The one-way multivariate analysis of variance (one-way MANOVA) is used to determine whether there are any differences between independent groups on more than one continuous dependent variable. In this regard, it differs from a one-way ANOVA, which only measures one dependent variable.
The typical assumptions of an ANOVA should be checked, such as normality, equality of variance, and univariate outliers. However, there are additional assumptions that should be checked when conducting a MANOVA. The additional assumptions of the MANOVA include: Absence of multivariate outliers.Jan 24, 2013
