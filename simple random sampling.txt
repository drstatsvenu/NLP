Simple random sampling is a sampling technique where every item in the population has an even chance and likelihood of being selected in the sample.
The main types of probability sampling methods are simple random sampling, stratified sampling, cluster sampling, multistage sampling, and systematic random sampling. The key benefit of probability sampling methods is that they guarantee that the sample chosen is representative of the population.
It is one of several methods statisticians and researchers use to extract a sample from a larger population; other methods include stratified random sampling and probability sampling. The advantages of a simple random sample include its ease of use and its accurate representation of the larger population.There are five types of sampling: Random, Systematic, Convenience, Cluster, and Stratified. Random sampling is analogous to putting everyone's name into a hat and drawing out several names. Each element in the population has an equal chance of occuring.
