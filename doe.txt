Design of experiments (DOE) is a systematic method to determine the relationship between factors affecting a process and the output of that process. In other words, it is used to find cause-and-effect relationships. This information is needed to manage process inputs in order to optimize the output.
Introduction. The term experiment is defined as the systematic procedure carried out under controlled conditions in order to discover an unknown effect, to test or establish a hypothesis, or to illustrate a known effect. ... Experiments can be designed in many different ways to collect this information.
There are three types of experiments you need to know:
Laboratory / Controlled Experiments. This type of experiment is conducted in a well-controlled environment (not necessarily a laboratory), where accurate measurements are possible. ...
Field Experiments. ...
Natural Experiments.
Obtaining good results from a DOE involves these seven steps:
Set objectives.
Select process variables.
Select an experimental design.
Execute the design.
Check that the data are consistent with the experimental assumptions.
Analyze and interpret the results.
Use/present the results (may lead to further runs or DOE's).
