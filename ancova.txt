ANCOVA evaluates whether the means of a dependent variable (DV) are equal across levels of a categorical independent variable (IV) often called a treatment, while statistically controlling for the effects of other continuous variables that are not of primary interest, known as covariates (CV) or nuisance variables.
ANCOVA. Analysis of covariance is used to test the main and interaction effects of categorical variables on a continuous dependent variable, controlling for the effects of selected other continuous variables, which co-vary with the dependent. The control variables are called the "covariates."
The obvious difference between ANOVA and ANCOVA is the the letter "C", which stands for 'covariance'. Like ANOVA, "Analysis of Covariance" (ANCOVA) has a single continuous response variable. ... The term for the continuous independent variable (IV) used in ANCOVA is "covariate".Aug 11, 2014
ANCOVA and multiple linear regression are similar, but regression is more appropriate when the emphasis is on the dependent outcome variable, while ANCOVA is more appropriate when the emphasis is on comparing the groups from one of the independent variables.Aug 14, 2011
