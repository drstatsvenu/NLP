Probability Sampling is a sampling technique in which sample from a larger population are chosen using a method based on the theory of probability. For a participant to be considered as a probability sample, he/she must be selected using a random selection.
The difference between nonprobability and probability sampling is that nonprobability sampling does not involve random selection and probability sampling does. ... At least with a probabilistic sample, we know the odds or probability that we have represented the population well.
A probability sampling method is any method of sampling that utilizes some form of random selection. In order to have a random selection method, you must set up some process or procedure that assures that the different units in your population have equal probabilities of being chosen.
The types of probability sampling are explained below:
Simple Random Sampling.
Stratified Random Sampling.
Systematic Sampling.
Cluster Sampling.
Multi-stage Sampling.
Purposive Sampling.
Convenience Sampling.
Snow-ball Sampling.
