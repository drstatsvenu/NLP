Sep 19, 2018 - Robust statistics, therefore, are any statistics that yield good performance when data is drawn from a wide range of probability distributions that are largely unaffected by outliers or small departures from model assumptions in a given dataset. In other words, a robust statistic is resistant to errors in the results.
Correlation also refers to a broad class of statistical measures aimed at characterizing the strength of the association between two variables. Among these latter measures, Pearson's correlation is the most widely used technique, despite its lack of robustness (Wilcox, 2012a,b).Jan 10, 2013
The most common such statistics are the interquartile range (IQR) and the median absolute deviation (MAD). These are contrasted with conventional measures of scale, such as sample variance or sample standard deviation, which are non-robust, meaning greatly influenced by outliers.
The t-test and robustness to non-normality. May 1, 2017 September 28, 2013 by Jonathan Bartlett. The t-test is one of the most commonly used tests in statistics. The two-sample t-test allows us to test the null hypothesis that the population means of two groups are equal, based on samples from each of the two groups.Sep 28, 2013
