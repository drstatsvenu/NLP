A scatter plot (also called a scatterplot, scatter graph, scatter chart, scattergram, or scatter diagram) is a type of plot or mathematical diagram using Cartesian coordinates to display values for typically two variables for a set of data. If the points are color-coded, one additional variable can be displayed.
The scatter diagram graphs pairs of numerical data, with one variable on each axis, to look for a relationship between them. If the variables are correlated, the points will fall along a line or curve. The better the correlation, the tighter the points will hug the line.
With scatter plots we often talk about how the variables relate to each other. This is called correlation. There are three types of correlation: positive, negative, and none (no correlation). Positive Correlation: as one variable increases so does the other.
Copy it to a new sheet and put the columns “healthcare expenditure total per person” and “life expectancy” next to each other. Click insert charts... and select “scatter plot” from charts. Select the first one, since this is what we want to do. And there you go: simply adapt the scatterplot so it looks nice.Sep 2, 2013
