Bayesian probability is an interpretation of the concept of probability, in which, instead of frequency or propensity of some phenomenon, probability is interpreted as reasonable expectation representing a state of knowledge or as quantification of a personal belief.The Bayesian interpretation of probability can be seen as an extension of propositional logic that enables reasoning with hypotheses.
