Poisson Process
A stochastic process is called a Poisson process with rates if all the following conditions hold
1.	Process initially starts at time zero with value zero
2.	Process has independent increments
3.	The number of arrivals in any interval of time length has Poisson distribution
4.	The probability of two or more events happening in time h is of order h
