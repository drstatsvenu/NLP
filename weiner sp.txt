Weiner Process
A standard one-dimensional Wiener process also called Brownian motion is a stochastic process indexed by nonnegative real numbers usually time with the following properties
1.	The process starts at time zero with initial value zero
2.	With probability one, stochastic process is continuous in time 
3.	The process has stationary, independent increments
4.	The increment has the normal distribution
