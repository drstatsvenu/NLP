Branching Process
The Branching Process is a simple but elegant model of population growth.
A branching process is defined as follows  
1.	There is a single individual at time zero
2.	Every individual lives exactly one unit of time, then produces offspring, and dies 
3.	The number of offspring may be 0, 1, 2, . . ., and there is some probability of producing k offspring 
4.	All individuals reproduce independently. Different individuals have different family sizes but the family sizes have the same distribution as that of offspring
Two common formulations of branching process are – 
•	Galton–Watson process
•	Random walk
