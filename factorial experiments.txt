In statistics, a full factorial experiment is an experiment whose design consists of two or more factors, each with discrete possible values or "levels", and whose experimental units take on all possible combinations of these levels across all such factors.
So a 2x2 factorial will have two levels or two factors and a 2x3 factorial will have three factors each at two levels. Typically, there are many factors such as gender, genotype, diet, housing conditions, experimental protocols, social interactions and age which can influence the outcome of an experiment.
Factorial designs are more efficient than OFAT experiments. They provide more information at similar or lower cost. They can find optimal conditions faster than OFAT experiments. Factorial designs allow additional factors to be examined at no additional cost.
Factorial design is a type of experimental design that involves having two independent variables, or factors, and one dependent variable. One type of result of a factorial design study is an interaction, which is when the two factors interact with each other to affect the dependent variable.Jan 8, 2014
