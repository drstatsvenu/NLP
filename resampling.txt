Resampling is the method that consists of drawing repeated samples from the original data samples. The method of Resampling is a nonparametric method of statistical inference.
The resampling is done to improve accuracy of model. There are different ways of resampling of data like bootstrapping, cross-validation, repeated cross-validation etc. Re-sampling is a series of methods used to reconstruct your sample data sets, including training sets and validation sets.
Bootstrap involves resampling with replacement and therefore each time produces a different sample and therefore different results. Jackknife on the other produces the same result. It is used to assess bias and variance. Bootstrap application is more cumbersome than that of the jackknife.
In statistics, resampling is any of a variety of methods for doing one of the following: Estimating the precision of sample statistics (medians, variances, percentiles) by using subsets of available data (jackknifing) or drawing randomly with replacement from a set of data points (bootstrapping)
Resampling means you're changing the pixel dimensions of an image. When you downsample, you're eliminating pixels and therefore deleting information and detail from your image. When you upsample, you're adding pixels. Photoshop adds these pixels by using interpolation.
